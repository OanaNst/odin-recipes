    <h3>About</h3>
    
    <p>Roughly translated to “cold things”, you might think: damn that looks gross; and you would be right. It truly does look disgusting. However, the taste blin. Give it a chance and you won’t be disappointed. Maybe don’t look at it too much.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 pork knuckle (about 1 kg)</li>
        <li>2 pig feet (about 350 grams each)</li>
        <li>2 garlic heads</li>
        <li>a lot of pepper</li>
        <li>a lot of salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to</h3>

    <p>First, cut the knuckle in half to ensure thorough cooking. Put the meats in a pressure cooker and cover them with water. Add a tablespoon of salt. Cook for about an hour. Put the cooked meats on a large plate and allow them to cool completely.</p>
    <p><strong>DO NOT THROW THE BROTH. THAT’S THE JELLY.</strong></p>
    <p>Crush the garlic and put it in the broth together with pepper to taste. Let it sit while the meats cool.</p>
    <p>When cooled, separate the meat from the bones. You can have the pieces of meat as large or small as you like. Put the pieces of meat in a large bowl and cover them with the broth. Put the bowl in the fridge and let it sit overnight.</p>
    <p>Next day, glorious răcituri are ready to be consumed with bread, potato or as is.</p>
