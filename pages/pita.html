    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>“Dripped bread”, this food is for the soul. This food has no calories, nutritional values or health risks. This you eat to your heart’s content. You need open fire for it and sticks. Fresh baked bread and fresh veggies are also highly recommended.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>hand-size chunk of smoked pig fat with rind</li>
        <li>freshly baked bread by grandma in her outdoor, stone oven</li>
        <li>fresh veggies: tomatoes (i know it’s a FrUiT), green onion, cucumber</li>
        <li>aged cheese, preferably goat’s</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to</h3>

    <p>First, prepare your slices of bread. Each slice should have generous amounts of cheese and veggies on it. Salt is optional, but welcomed.</p>
    <p>Cut up the chunk of fat as you see in the picture: the end result should be bite-sized pieces.<strong> Be careful not to cut too deep,</strong> the pieces still need to be attached to the rind. Stick the fat on a stick and start cooking over the fire.</p>
    <p>The fat will start dripping so be careful not to waste any of that goodness. Keep you slices close and each time the fat drips, have your bread under it. Drip the fat on each slice and cook the chunk until it looks like in the picture.</p>
    <p>Remember how you cut the fat in bite-size pieces? Yes blyat, now that they are cooked, you cut them down and enjoy them with your glorious pită picurată.</p>
