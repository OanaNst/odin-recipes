    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>Normally, Boeuf salad is made with beef. Not here. We donâ€™t do this here. Mostly because we are poor. Instead, we use chicken and the end result is just as delicious. This glorious mayonnaise heaven is a Christmas special and, in some homes, a holiday must.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>8 potatoes</li>
        <li>5 carrots</li>
        <li>1 celery root</li>
        <li>2 parsnips</li>
        <li>2 parsley roots</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>6 pickled cucumbers</li>
        <li>home-made mayonnaise (4 eggs, 2 tablespoons sweet mustard, half a liter sun-flower oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to</h3>

    <p>Boil your chicken and veggies (minus the pickles, duh) in salted water until everything is soft.</p>
    <p>While your ingredients are cooking, make the home-made mayonnaise. Use a mixer or kitchen robot to avoid unnecessary suffering. Add 2 raw yolks and 2 cooked yolks and the 2 tablespoons of mustard. Start mixing and slowly add in your oil.<strong>Be careful not to add too much oil at once, or your mayonnaise will split.</strong></p>
    <p>After your meat and veggies are done cooking, put them aside and let cool completely. When cool, slice them finely, ideally into equal-sized cubes.</p>
    <p>Add everything into a big enough bowl and start gently mixing. You now have glorious Boeuf salad and you can enjoy it with other cooked dishes, bread or as is.</p>
