    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>Normally, Boeuf salad is made with beef. Not here. We don’t do this here. Mostly because we are poor. Instead, we use chicken and the end result is just as delicious. This glorious mayonnaise heaven is a Christmas special and, in some homes, a holiday must.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>8 potatoes</li>
        <li>5 carrots</li>
        <li>1 celery root</li>
        <li>2 parsnips</li>
        <li>2 parsley roots</li>
        <li>2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>6 pickled cucumbers</li>
        <li>home-made mayonnaise (4 eggs, 2 tablespoons sweet mustard, half a liter sun-flower oil</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How to</h3>

    <p>Boil your chicken and veggies (minus the pickles, duh) in salted water until everything is soft.</p>
    <p>While your ingredients are cooking, make the home-made mayonnaise. Use a mixer or kitchen robot to avoid unnecessary suffering. Add 2 raw yolks and 2 cooked yolks and the 2 tablespoons of mustard. Start mixing and slowly add in your oil.<strong> Be careful not to add too much oil at once, or your mayonnaise will split.</strong></p>
    <p>After your meat and veggies are done cooking, put them aside and let cool completely. When cool, slice them finely, ideally into equal-sized cubes.</p>
    <p>Add everything into a big enough bowl and start gently mixing. You now have glorious Boeuf salad and you can enjoy it with other cooked dishes, bread or as is.</p>
